# Spotify-Web-Player-Clone
This project is a web-based Spotify UI clone designed to mimic the interface of Spotify's web player. It is built using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome for icons, and it features a responsive layout with a sidebar, music player controls, and card-based content sections for browsing playlists and trending songs.
